#### Conclusion 
The data of four sport teams of Detroit exhibits the win rate changes of all teams in a long-term period of 1948 - 2019.
On the overview, all of the teams have a long history and long-recorded of performance. But each Detroit sport team's average win rate is lower than 50%. The historic average win rate of all teams are in range of 40%-60%, however, it began to drop since 2015.
For each team:
 * The team has the best perfomance is Detroit Tigers, which has a relatively stable win rate around 49%, although its best win rate is the lowest among all teams;
 * Detroit Lions have the highest win rate of all in 1953, but its win rate changed very frequently (back and forth);
 * And both of Detroit Pistons and Detroit Red Wings have best win rate in 2005, and their recent performance are good (mostly higher than 50%).
 
The win rate of a sport team could be related to its management, property and local economy, etc., therefore the changes of win rate of a sport team could tell a story of these hiden information. The prediction of future win rate requires more attributes to fit into statistic models, to achieve this purpose, more works data collection and analysis are needed beforehead.
